# landmark_detection_PIN


This is my dissertation project.
The goal of this project is using PIN algorithm for Landmark detection.

The original paper for this idea is published by https://github.com/yuanwei1989/landmark-detection

The main idea of these code is taken from Yuanwei Li's work and some code is edited by me.

For training and predicting in PyTorch in this project is done by me.
